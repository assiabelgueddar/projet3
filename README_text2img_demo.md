# 🖼️ Text2Img Demo - Image Generation from Text Prompts

This project is a simple and fast **Text-to-Image generator** built using **Gradio** and **Stable Diffusion SDXL-Turbo** via Hugging Face Diffusers.  
It enables users to generate high-quality images based on natural language prompts instantly.

---

## 💡 Description

This project demonstrates how to use `stabilityai/sdxl-turbo` to convert user prompts into realistic images using only 2 inference steps.  
It is deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/assiabelgueddar/text2img-demo) and uses a clean, interactive Gradio interface.
